# Feature Suggestions

### Already Completed
- [x] Redone UI
- [x] Dark theme(ask if you want a light theme, because I won’t do it unless if requested)
- [x] Categories(implementation subject to change)
- [x] Statusbar with activity indicator(move UI out of RootWindow, and move indicator to Statusbar)
- [x] Removal of splash screen
- [x] Moved Game icon to main info page
- [x] Use proper thumbnails for screenshots
- [x] Add Vn/Settings no longer in pop-out window
- [x] Allow you to update vnList, votelist, and wishlist from program
(should) not choke on 1000+ vns in your list
- [x] Add visual novel by title(ask if you want titles to show up while typing, otherwise it will only show titles when clicking search)
- [x] Obfuscated NSFW images on disk to make it hard to view by others, encoded as base64

### Will Not Add
Saved login with autologin to vndb button  (This would require me to encrypt the plaintext password, and unencrypt it to use it. Due to security issues surrounding this, I will NOT implement this, while the password is being sent in plaintext)

### Already Planned
* Add support for DLsite(will be implemented MUCH later in program, feature requests are encouraged)
* Section tags/traits off into All/Content/Sexual Content/Technical Content

### High Possibility Of Adding
* Run in taskbar when game is running
* Automatic updater
* Importer from GameManager program that uses dlsite
* Vndb website within program <do you have tabs?>
* Have a visual novel scanner to search for user’s visual novels on local hard drive(this will be difficult, so it needs a lot of requests if I will do this)
* uservnlist/wishlist/votelist with advanced sorting
* Related visual novels

### Might Add If Requested
* Multiple user profiles
* Search for walkthrough/savegame
* Password required to do activities(change NSFW settings, set votes/status/…, view any data,....)

### Suggested Features-
* I would love a producer section, i.e. list all VNs from Key
* Add a category to sort by release date. Maybe also sort by Metacritic ratings.
* Be able to sort visual novels, and name categories, also being able to create sub categories would be nice. Example: sort by translated, or untranslated. Then further sort by producer/genre
* DMM, Erogamescape and Getchu as alternative metadata providers. VNDB is way too anal about what makes a VN and as such misses a bit. Option to get EN or JP metadata(or both) from DLSite
* As a followup to the earlier Visual Novel scanner suggestion, make a user-contributed database of hashes(CRC, SHA etc) of the specific exe files which will make recognition eventually very accurate. 
* Minimize to System tray.
* The Option to add multiple .EXE to one VN. For things like external Config.EXE. Or some VN like “Bazooka Cafe” that have seperate .EXE for bonus scenarios.
* Option to choose the name of any of the “Releases” as main name/ manually rename VN. Different versions are listed as separate releases instead of their own VN and VNDB tends to use the romanized japanese name if there are only fan translations.
* Option to not having VN’s show up in the ALL tab if they are added to a category.
* Adding “Open containing folder ” to context menu.
* Adding “Open Save File folder”  to context menu.
* Adding “Open VNDB page in browser” to context menu
* Option to sort VN/Category alphabetically/manually.
* Option to set custom cover Images
* Have double click on name start VN in library.
* More space for the VN summary.(Some just cut off in the middle)
* Make things (Context menu, playtime counter, etc.) work for the game in question, not the currently selected one. 
* !!Add a scrolling bar to main Library.(Seriously WTF is this not a thing yet? The way it is right now, even with small font, you can’t even fit 50. I have 120, making this program completely unusable for me.)!!
* Ability to modify visual novel install location after adding it.
* Ability to add a game that is not installed to the Manager and make Play button inactive for these titles. 
* Custom tags to apply to games seperate from Categories. Ie: A game could be in category “Completed” and be tagged with “To Stream”, “100% completed”, etc.
* User specified rating of game (ex: 5 stars) just within the app - nothing to do with submitting a rating to VNDB.
* Custom fields for games in the Manager, such as a field for game notes, completed date, cost of purchase, etc. 
* Add option to put in a custom boxart. 
* Ability to customize data displayed on Visual Novel Information pane. Ex: Do not show “Popularity” and “Aliases” information. 
* Add other VNDB fields such as Developer/Publisher to the Visual Novel Information pane.
* It may make sense to have users optionally select the specific release of the game they have. IE: The official English localization of game X as opposed to the Japanese listing which will have Japanese naming and publisher. 
* Note, not new feature: Clicking between games in your library takes longer than it should due to loading for 5-10 seconds each time. Not sure why it is so slow, or if it is my machine, but it definitely is an annoyance.
